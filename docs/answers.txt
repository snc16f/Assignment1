The RoleGame prototype uses polymorphism. Looking at the implementation files, it is apparant that there is a hierarchy of
classes that are related. Polymorphism uses virtual functions as well as function name overloading which RoleGame presents.
For example, the function hit(double armor) is named the same for every weapon derived class and is
also presented as a virtual function. This function essentially is a member function of the base class 'Weapon', but is 
overridden in the derived classes, 'CommonSpear', 'SimpleHammer' , etc. This allows each individual function to have
a unique function definition than the base class hit(double armor) function definition.
